# password-generator
### A random password generator in python
This is a very simple password generator, written in python.
You just need to tell the number of letters, numbers and symbols that you want in your password.
I have written the code for two types of password :
1. Simple password:
   - This will generate a password which will be in the same order as your choice of characters.
   - All the numbers, symbols and letters will be consecutive.
   - This code is easy to write and requires less effort.
2. Hard password:
   - This will generate a password which will be totally randomised.
   - All the characters will be randomised.
   - This code is not that easy to write and requires a bit of critical logical thinking, if you are a beginner like me (as of now).
